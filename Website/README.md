# Medkit Website

Next.js app for the Medkit first-aid coach product site. Deploy to Vercel by connecting this repo and setting the root to `website` (or deploy from the `website` directory).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Build & deploy (Vercel)

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

On Vercel: connect your repo, set **Root Directory** to `website`, and use the default build command `npm run build` and output (Next.js).

The previous Vite app lives in `src/`; you can remove that folder if you no longer need it.
